# Flexbox Project

## Description
This project focuses on learning and practicing CSS Flexbox. I use Flexbox to build layouts, replace float-based positioning, and align elements properly in a responsive way using only HTML and CSS.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I am able to:
- Explain what Flexbox is and why it is useful
- Convert layouts based on floats to Flexbox
- Align elements horizontally and vertically using Flexbox
- Understand the difference between the main axis and the cross axis
- Distinguish properties applied to flex containers from those applied to flex items
- Use flex shorthand properties
- Build a page with Flexbox in mind from the start

## Resources
- A Complete Guide to Flexbox (CSS-Tricks)
- Flexbox Froggy
- Flexbox Defense
- Flexbox Cheatsheet
- MDN – CSS Flexible Box Layout
- Awesome Flexbox (GitHub)
- Flexplorer

## Requirements
- All files must end with a new line
- A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project
- This project is built using only HTML and CSS
- No external libraries or frameworks are used
- Required images are stored in an `images` directory at the root of the project

## Notes
I focus on structuring my HTML properly before applying Flexbox rules in CSS, in order to keep the layout clean and maintainable.
