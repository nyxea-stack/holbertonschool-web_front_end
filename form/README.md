# HTML Forms Project

## Description  
This project is focused on learning how to design, build, and improve web forms using only HTML and CSS â€” without any external libraries. The main goal is to create forms that are not only functional, but also accessible and easy to use.

## Project Objectives  
At the end of this project, I should be able to:  
- Build an HTML5 form from scratch  
- Choose appropriate input types depending on the use case  
- Use regular expressions to add constraints to fields  
- Style valid, invalid, and required inputs using CSS  
- Create common UI patterns like a comment form or a search form  
- Ensure good usability and accessibility across all forms  

## Resources  
I'm referring to the following resources to guide my work:  
- [MDN - HTML forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms)  
- [Deque - Accessible Forms](https://www.deque.com/blog/anatomy-of-accessible-forms-best-practices/)

- [CSS Tricks - Form Validation UX](https://css-tricks.com/form-validation-part-1-constraint-validation-html-css/)  

## Constraints  
- No JavaScript, no libraries (React, Vue, Bootstrap, etc.)  
- Only pure HTML and CSS  
- Must work on Chrome 78+  
- All files should end with a new line
