# Developer Tools - Navigating and Debugging Web Pages

## Description
This project introduces the powerful Developer Tools (DevTools) integrated into modern browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. These tools help developers inspect, debug, and optimize web pages in real-time.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I will be able to:
- Understand what Developer Tools are in modern browsers.
- Open and navigate the Developer Tools on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- Use the "Elements" tab to edit HTML and CSS live.
- Perform audits on web pages using Lighthouse.
- Create and execute JavaScript snippets directly in the browser.
- Analyze files and server configurations via the "Network" tab.
- Block specific requests to simulate scenarios.
- Evaluate how much JavaScript or CSS is used on a page.
- Detect and debug 404 errors.
- Move, modify, or delete elements on a web page dynamically.

## Requirements
- A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
- Use Google Chrome version 78.0.3904.70 or later.
- Screenshots can be taken with the operating system tools; using DevTools for screenshots is optional.
